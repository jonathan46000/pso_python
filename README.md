# pso_basic

Simple particle swarm optimizer written in Python. Modified from the [adaptive timestep PSO optimizer](https://github.com/jonathan46000/pso_python) by [jonathan46000](https://github.com/jonathan46000) for data collection baseline. This repository removes the adaptive time modulation step of pso_python.

pso_basic has been updated to increase modularity with the optimizer suite collection.

## Particle Swarm Optimization

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a popular nature-inspired optimization algorithm introduced in "Particle Swarm Optimization" [1] (J. Kennedy & R. Eberhart, 1995). It is inspired by the social behavior animal groups, often compared to birds flocking or fish schooling. PSO is used to find approximate solutions to complex optimization problems.

PSO consists of a population (or swarm) of candidate solutions called particles. Each particle moves through the search space, influenced by its own best-known position and the best-known positions of the swarm. The algorithm combines exploration and exploitation to find the optimal solution.

### State Machine-based Structure

This optimizer uses a state machine structure to control the movement of the particles, call to the objective function, and the evaluation of current positions. The state machine implementation preserves the initial algorithm while making it possible to integrate other programs, classes, or functions as the objective function.

A controller with a `while loop` to check the completion status of the optimizer drives the process. Completion status is determined by at least 1) a set MAX number of iterations, and 2) the convergence to a given target using the L2 norm.  Iterations are counted by calls to the objective function. 

Within this `while loop` are three function calls to control the optimizer class:
* **complete**: the `complete function` checks the status of the optimizer and if it has met the convergence or stop conditions.
* **step**: the `step function` takes a boolean variable (suppress_output) as an input to control detailed printout on current particle (or agent) status. This function moves the optimizer one step forward.  
* **call_objective**: the `call_objective function` takes a boolean variable (allow_update) to control if the objective function is able to be called. In most implementations, this value will always be true. However, there may be cases where the controller or a program running the state machine needs to assert control over this function without stopping the loop.

Additionally, **get_convergence_data** can be used to preview the current status of the optimizer, including the current best evaluation and the iterations.

The code below is an example of this process:

```python
    while not myOptimizer.complete():
        # step through optimizer processing
        # this will update particle or agent locations
        myOptimizer.step(suppress_output)
        # call the objective function, control 
        # when it is allowed to update and return 
        # control to optimizer
        myOptimizer.call_objective(allow_update)
        # check the current progress of the optimizer
        # iter: the number of objective function calls
        # eval: current 'best' evaluation of the optimizer
        iter, eval = myOptimizer.get_convergence_data()
        if (eval < best_eval) and (eval != 0):
            best_eval = eval
        
        # optional. if the optimizer is not printing out detailed 
        # reports, preview by checking the iteration and best evaluation

        if suppress_output:
            if iter%100 ==0: #print out every 100th iteration update
                print("Iteration")
                print(iter)
                print("Best Eval")
                print(best_eval)
```

### Constraint Handling
Users must create their own constraint function for their problems, if there are constraints beyond the problem bounds.  This is then passed into the constructor. If the default constraint function is used, it always returns true (which means there are no constraints).

### Boundary Types
This PSO optimizer has 4 different types of bounds, Random (Particles that leave the area respawn), Reflection (Particles that hit the bounds reflect), Absorb (Particles that hit the bounds lose velocity in that direction), Invisible (Out of bound particles are no longer evaluated).

Some updates have not incorporated appropriate handling for all boundary conditions. This bug is known and is being worked on. The most consistent boundary type at the moment is Random. If constraints are violated, but bounds are not, currently random bound rules are used to deal with this problem. 

### Multi-Object Optimization
The no preference method of multi-objective optimization, but a Pareto Front is not calculated. Instead, the best choice (smallest norm of output vectors) is listed as the output.

### Objective Function Handling
The optimizer minimizes the absolute value of the difference of the target outputs and the evaluated outputs. Future versions may include options for function minimization when target values are absent. 

#### Creating a Custom Objective Function

Custom objective functions can be used by creating a directory with the following files:
* configs_F.py
* constr_F.py
* func_F.py

`configs_F.py` contains lower bounds, upper bounds, the number of input variables, the number of output variables, the target values, and a global minimum if known. This file is used primarily for unit testing and evaluation of accuracy. If these values are not known, or are dynamic, then they can be included experimentally in the controller that runs the optimizer's state machine. 

`constr_F.py` contains a function called `constr_F` that takes in an array, `X`, of particle positions to determine if the particle or agent is in a valid or invalid location. 

`func_F.py` contains the objective function, `func_F`, which takes two inputs. The first input, `X`, is the array of particle or agent positions. The second input, `NO_OF_OUTS`, is the integer number of output variables, which is used to set the array size. In included objective functions, the default value is hardcoded to work with the specific objective function.

Below are examples of the format for these files.

`configs_F.py`:
```python
OBJECTIVE_FUNC = func_F
CONSTR_FUNC = constr_F
OBJECTIVE_FUNC_NAME = "one_dim_x_test.func_F" #format: FUNCTION NAME.FUNCTION
CONSTR_FUNC_NAME = "one_dim_x_test.constr_F" #format: FUNCTION NAME.FUNCTION

# problem dependent variables
LB = [[0]]             # Lower boundaries
UB = [[1]]             # Upper boundaries
IN_VARS = 1            # Number of input variables (x-values)
OUT_VARS = 1           # Number of output variables (y-values) 
TARGETS = [0]          # Target values for output
GLOBAL_MIN = []        # Global minima sample, if they exist. 

```

`constr_F.py`, with no constraints:
```python
def constr_F(x):
    F = True
    return F
```

`constr_F.py`, with constraints:
```python
def constr_F(X):
    F = True
    # objective function/problem constraints
    if (X[2] > X[0]/2) or (X[2] < 0.1):
        F = False
    return F
```

`func_F.py`:
```python
import numpy as np
import time

def func_F(X, NO_OF_OUTS=1):
    F = np.zeros((NO_OF_OUTS))
    noErrors = True
    try:
        x = X[0]
        F = np.sin(5 * x**3) + np.cos(5 * x) * (1 - np.tanh(x ** 2))
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        noErrors = False

    return [F], noErrors
```


#### Internal Objective Function Example

There are three functions included in the repository:
1) Himmelblau's function, which takes 2 inputs and has 1 output
2) A multi-objective function with 3 inputs and 2 outputs (see lundquist_3_var)
3) A single-objective function with 1 input and 1 output (see one_dim_x_test)

Each function has four files in a directory:
   1) configs_F.py - contains imports for the objective function and constraints, CONSTANT assignments for functions and labeling, boundary ranges, the number of input variables, the number of output values, and the target values for the output
   2) constr_F.py - contains a function with the problem constraints, both for the function and for error handling in the case of under/overflow. 
   3) func_F.py - contains a function with the objective function.
   4) graph.py - contains a script to graph the function for visualization.

Other multi-objective functions can be applied to this project by following the same format (and several have been collected into a compatible library, and will be released in a separate repo)

## Example Implementations

### Basic PSO Example
`main_test.py` provides a sample use case of the optimizer. 

### Detailed Messages
`main_test_details.py` provides an example using a parent class, and the self.suppress_output flag to control error messages that are passed back to the parent class to be printed with a timestamp. This implementation sets up the hooks for integration with AntennaCAT in order to provide the user feedback of warnings and errors.

### Realtime Graph

<p align="center">
        <img src="media/pso_graph.gif" alt="Example PSO Convergence" height="200">
</p>

`main_test_graph.py` provides an example using a parent class, and the self.suppress_output flag to control error messages that are passed back to the parent class to be printed with a timestamp. Additionally, a realtime graph shows particle locations at every step.

NOTE: if you close the graph as the code is running, the code will continue to run, but the graph will not re-open.
