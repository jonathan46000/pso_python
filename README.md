# pso_basic

Simple particle swarm optimizer written in Python. Modified from the [adaptive timestep PSO optimizer](https://github.com/jonathan46000/pso_python) by [jonathan46000](https://github.com/jonathan46000) for data collection baseline. This repo removes the adaptive time modulation step of pso_python.

Now featuring AntennaCAT hooks for GUI integration and user input handling.

## Implementation
### Constraint Handling
Users must create their own constraint function for their problems, if there are constraints beyond the problem bounds.  This is then passed into the constructor. If the default constraint function is used, it always returns true (which means there are no constraints).

### Boundary Types
This PSO optimizers has 4 different types of bounds, Random (Particles that leave the area respawn), Reflection (Particles that hit the bounds reflect), Absorb (Particles that hit the bounds lose velocity in that direction), Invisible (Out of bound particles are no longer evaluated).

Some updates have not incorporated appropriate handling for all boundary conditions.  This bug is known and is being worked on.  The most consistent boundary type at the moment is Random.  If constraints are violated, but bounds are not, currently random bound rules are used to deal with this problem. 

### Multi-Object Optimization
The no preference method of multi-objective optimization, but a Pareto Front is not calculated. Instead the best choice (smallest norm of output vectors) is listed as the output.

### Objective Function Handling
The optimizer minimizes the absolute value of the difference from the target outputs and the evaluated outputs.  Future versions may include options for function minimization absent target values. 

#### Internal Objective Function Example
The current internal optimization function takes 3 inputs, and has 2 outputs. It was created as a simple 3-variable optimization objective function that would be quick to converge.

```math
\text{minimize}: 
\begin{cases}
f_{1}(\mathbf{x}) = (x_1-0.5)^2 + (x_2-0.1)^2 \\
f_{2}(\mathbf{x}) = (x_3-0.2)^4
\end{cases}
```

| Num. Input Variables| Boundary | Constraints |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 3      | $0.21\leq x_1\leq 1$ <br> $0\leq x_2\leq 1$ <br> $0.1 \leq x_3\leq 0.5$  | $x_3\gt \frac{x_1}{2}$ or $x_3\lt 0.1$| 


This function has three files:
   1) configs_F.py - contains imports for the objective function and constraints, CONSTANT assignments for functions and labeling, boundary ranges, the number of input variables, the number of output values, and the target values for the output
   2) constr_F.py - contains a function with the problem constraints, both for the function and for error handling in the case of under/overflow. 
   3) func_F.py - contains a function with the objective function.

Other multi-objective functions can be applied to this project by following the same format (and several have been collected into a compatable library, and will be realeased in a seperate repo)



## Example Implementations

### Basic PSO Example
pso_test.py provides a sample use case of the optimizer. 

### Detailed Messages
pso_test_details.py provides an example using a parent class, and the self.suppress_output and detailedWarnings flags to control error messages that are passed back to the parent class to be printed with a timestamp. This implementation sets up the hooks for integration with AntennaCAT in order to provide the user feedback of warnings and errors.

### Realtime Graph

<p align="center">
        <img src="https://github.com/LC-Linkous/pso_python/blob/main/media/pso_graph.gif" alt="Example PSO Convergence" height="200">
</p>

pso_test_graph.py provides an example using a parent class, and the self.suppress_output and detailedWarnings flags to control error messages that are passed back to the parent class to be printed with a timestamp. Additionally, a realtime graph shows particle locations at every step.

NOTE: if you close the graph as the code is running, the code will continue to run, but the graph will not re-open.
